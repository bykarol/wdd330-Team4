## Description

In this project, we will build tents and an outdoor items website. It scaffolds a simple web app with Vite support to bundle up our assets.

## Prerequisites

- We will need to have Node installed and some npm packages.

## Setup

- `npm install` installs the npm Software Registry.
- `npm run start` starts up a local server and updates on any JS or CSS/SCSS changes.

## Other commands

- `npm run build` We will use npm build to build the final files when you are ready to turn in.
- `npm run lint` We will use npm run to run ESLint against your code to find errors.
- `npm run format` We will use run format to run Prettier to format your code automatically.
